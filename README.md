Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

I developed a detailed Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to explore trends and key metrics related to employee turnover. Using DAX formulas for calculations, I provided insights to support HR decision-making. Key metrics include:

Total employees: 1,470 | Employees quit: 237 | Attrition rate: 16%
Average age: 36.92 | Active employees: 1,233
Attrition by Department: Highest in R&D (65.37%) and lowest in HR (4.29%).
Attrition by Age Group & Gender: Highest attrition in the 35–44 age group.
Work-Life Balance: Dissatisfaction highest among Healthcare Representatives.
Job Satisfaction: Average score of 2.73 (scale of 1-4).
Attrition by Education: Life Sciences had the highest attrition (89 employees).
This project highlights my ability to leverage DAX and Power BI for advanced data analytics and visualization, delivering actionable business insights.
